# Neural Network for Non-linear Classification & Regression

- demo
  - linear inseparable case (complex, radial)
  - ovelay neural network hidden unit vectors
  - hyperplan comparision by bias (interpret)
  - tracking original space and represenatation space with h=(2 - 10 - 5 - 2)
  - non-linear regression case (quadratic line)
  - unify 1d -> 1d
